# Decisions log

Decisions made during autonomous implementation that were not fully specified
in CLAUDE.md or the phase docs. Each entry says what was decided and why the
simplest option was chosen. Anything here can be revisited.

## 2026-09-05 — Repo bootstrap

- **Git state.** `github.com/Rahul100897/grossline` had zero commits and zero
  refs (verified with `git ls-remote`). "Preserve remote history and rebase
  onto it" was therefore a no-op: the local directory was `git init`-ed on
  `main` with `origin` pointing at the GitHub repo, and history starts here.
  Nothing was force-pushed or discarded.
- **`.env.example` values blanked.** All previously non-empty values were
  local-dev defaults or API version strings, not credentials
  (`NODE_ENV=development`, localhost `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`,
  `MASTER_KEY_VERSION=1`, `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2026-07`,
  `META_API_VERSION=v21.0`). They were moved into comments so local setup
  stays documented. **No real credentials were found; nothing needs rotating.**
- **`.gitignore` merge.** Remote had no `.gitignore` (empty repo), so the
  local version stands. It already covered `.env`, `.DS_Store`,
  `node_modules/`, `docs/scratch/`. Added `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (session-local Claude Code permission state, not shared config).
- **Scratch clone.** `~/Documents/grossline-repo` (created in an earlier
  session as a staging copy) is now redundant — every file in it exists in
  this repo. It was left in place because deleting directories was out of
  scope for autonomous mode; safe to delete manually.
## 2026-09-05 — Task 0.1 monorepo scaffold

- **Local ports 5433/6380.** This machine already runs Postgres on 5432 and
  Redis on 6379 for other projects, so `docker-compose.yml` maps grossline to
  5433 (Postgres) and 6380 (Redis). CI uses the standard ports via service
  containers; nothing in code hardcodes either — everything reads
  `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL`.
- **Separate test database.** `docker/initdb` creates `grossline_test` next to
  `grossline`. Tests use `TEST_DATABASE_URL` when set, falling back to
  `DATABASE_URL` (CI points `DATABASE_URL` straight at its test database).
- **No build step for internal packages.** `@grossline/core` and
  `@grossline/db` export TypeScript source directly; consumers run it via
  tsx/vitest, and Next uses `transpilePackages`. Simplest thing that works for
  a repo where nothing is published; revisit if a deploy target needs JS.
- **Tailwind now, shadcn/ui when there is real UI.** Tailwind v4 is wired into
  the admin app because it is the stack. shadcn/ui component installs are
  deferred until a task actually needs components beyond a form and a table.
- **`seed:demo` deferred.** CLAUDE.md lists it, but "18 months of sample data"
  requires the raw tables and connector shapes that only exist from Phase 1.
  The root script exists and fails with an explanation. `seed:admin` (task
  0.6) is separate and does exist.
- **`--passWithNoTests`** on packages whose test suites land in later tasks,
  so `pnpm verify` is meaningful from the first commit.

- **Direct pushes to `main`.** README says `main` is protected with PR-only
  merges. Branch protection is a GitHub setting that does not exist yet on a
  fresh repo, and the instruction for this bootstrap phase was one commit per
  task pushed after each. Phase 0 commits therefore go directly to `main`;
  turn on branch protection before Phase 1.
